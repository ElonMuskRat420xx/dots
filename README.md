These are my dotfiles

- Scripts are in `~/.local/bin/`
- Settings for:
	- vim/nvim (text editor)
	- zsh (shell)
	- lf (file manager)
	- mpd/ncmpcpp (music)
	- mpv (video player)
- I try to minimize what's directly in `~` so:
	- All configs that can be in `~/.config/` are.
	
## Usage

These dotfiles are intended to go with numerous suckless programs I use:

- [dwm](https://github.com/ElonMuskRat420xx/dwm) (window manager)
- [st](https://github.com/ElonMuskRat420xx/st) (terminal emulator)
